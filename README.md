Family trips
============

Family-trips is a project for sharing ideas about trips you could take, possibly with your family, 
possibly at the weekend.

The list of main functionalities:
------------
1. Enter some trips you had and share them with your friends.
2. Find what trips your friends recommend by distance, duration, type of a trip.
3. Save places worth to visit (wish-list, wish-to-repeat)
4. Save recommendations of accomodations.
5. Not intended for commercial ads, more about sharing your personal experience with friends and your personal register.

The project exists for two main reasons:
------------
1. I couldn't find similar project anywhere else.
2. I'd like to try some new techniques and technologies which are not always possible at my professional job. I mean things like clean code, newest web techs, cloud, mashups, mobile.

Different projects in this area

2. Public list of trips http://www.fajny-weekend.pl/content/section/4/35/, outdated, no possibility to collaborate
