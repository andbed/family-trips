family-trips
============

Family-trips is a project for sharing ideas about trips you could take, possibly with your family, 
possibly at the weekend.

The list of main functionalities:
1. Enter some trips and share them with friends.
2. Find what my friends recommend by distance, duration, type of a trip.
3. Save places worth to visit (wish-list, wish-to-repeat)
4. Save recommendations of accomodations.

The project exists for two main reasons:
1. I couldn't find similar project anywhere else.
2. I'd like to try some new techniques and technologies which are not always possible at my professional job. I mean things like clean code, newest web techs, cloud, mashups, mobile.
